  <weibo id="1" polarity="1">I have a white and black toy poodle that had terrible large brown eye stains and I tried a couple of different products, drops for food, liquid to wipe the stains with a cotton ball - nothing worked. I had heard about Angel Eyes before but did nothing. Then I talked to a groomer who told me about it, so I broke down and bought a bottle.</weibo>
  <weibo id="2" polarity="1">Yes, this product does exactly what it says it does and it does it very well - better than any other i've tried...BUT it doesn't work as well on all fur types. I have one terrier mix with fluffy fur/hair and two pugs. The Furminator works wonders on the terrier mix, on my male pug it works okay and on my female pug it pulls nothing (perhaps someone can make a suggestion?). It is worth my expense only because completely deshedding just one dog helps.</weibo>
  <weibo id="3" polarity="1">We use this thing all the time!  It is a little bit loud, but it is fantastic.  We made watermelon sorbet last night in less than 30 minutes from prep to finish -- perfect!  I highly recommend this maker.</weibo>
  <weibo id="4" polarity="-1">Although the documentation indicates that you are able to stop the wireless network from broadcasting the SSID, the option is not available.  I contacted Netgear and they agreed that this was a problem and it was going to be fixed in the next firmware release.  They stated that the firmware was in the final days of testing.  That was two weeks ago.  The ability to stop broadcasting the SSID is a basic security feature.  I would not purchase this product until the new firmware is released.</weibo>
  <weibo id="5" polarity="-1">I ordered two Feliway electric diffusers from Absolutely Pets on February 6. After two e-mails to the company, which where rapidly answered, I received my package... on March 12. This company needs improvements on shipping.</weibo>
